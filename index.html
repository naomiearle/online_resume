           <h2>Aspiring Web Developer</h2>

           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>I started learning to code as a hobby after graduating from university in July 2019, and quickly realised that web development was the career I had been searching for - it was the perfect balance between logical and creative thinking. I picked up HTML and CSS with relative ease using free resources found online, and started using Codecademy after a few months so that I could get some practical experience with projects. I believe that the language learning skills I developed through studying foreign languages in school and university has lead to my ability to pick up coding languages quickly.</p>
           <p>I am currently looking for an entry-level or graduate position in Yorkshire as either a front-end or full-stack web developer. My principal aim with regards to my work at this stage is to improve my technical skills as much as possible and to gain experience in the industry and working with fellow developers as part of a creative team. In future, I am interested in becoming a lead developer and mentoring entry-level developers myself.</p>
